    In my opinion, there is a lot that Bridle has stated in this passage that is in a lot of eye-opening ways. I was unaware of the fact that many likes, views, etc. are bots themselves racking up the numbers on certain videos, pictures, etc. I feel as if in a lot of ways, he makes a compelling point by bringing up how false of a world we can live in at times. I think it is very disgusting to think that it's getting harder to separate a lie from the truth when it comes to the internet nowadays.  I also feel as if it's not good, as he was saying to have children exposed to such sensitive content at too early of an age.  However, from an adult's perspective, I feel as if there is only so much anyone can do to mediate what their child is intaking digitally. It's a catch 22 situation in my eyes.
    
I have a hard time agreeing with Bridle's solutions, however due to one underlying question that remains unanswered to me: how exactly can we stop this unhealthy internet trend from occurring? It's apparent to me that Bridle doesn't want to continuously see children being traumatized going forward throughout their youth. In the passage, I read many cases, and stories on what was wrong with the internet. I just am not understanding what he proposes we do to stop this. Should we delete bots and automated algorithms altogether? Should we bring back a greater human aspect to the internet behind the scene? I feel as if having somewhat greater internet security could help, however, no one can prevent everything from happening. I am interested in seeing specifically in what ways such as these, does Bridle think we can reduce/erase this issue of internet corruptivity.
